  "theoreticalDescription": "A theoretical description as to how the chords are constructed can be found above each diagram.",
  "patternsShowcased": "The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.",
