        The chord diagrams found on this page showcase one way in which to play
        each chord type. Use the navigation bookmarks above to quickly jump to
        the img file for the chord type you require.
      </p>
      <p>
        A theoretical description as to how the chords are constructed can be
        found above each diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of
        play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such
        as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the
        lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't
        always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on
        the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted
        state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the
        overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are
        pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or
        bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.

      <p>Major Chords</p>
      <p>
        The basic Major chord consists of three notes. The chord is formed using
        the Root (1), Major Third (3) and Perfect Fifth (5) intervals of each
        Major scale. To construct the C Major and E Major chord you begin with
        the scale consisting of the following notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Major Scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E Major Scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Extracting the three notes required from these scales means applying the
        following formula to each scale:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Major Chord Formula: 1, 3, 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Major Chord Formula: Root, Major Third, Perfect Fifth</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is the C Major and E Major Chord consisting of the following
        notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Major Chord: C, E, G</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E Major Chord: E, G#, B</b>

      <p>Minor Chords</p>
      <p>
        The basic Minor chord consists of three notes. The chord is formed using
        the Root (1), Minor Third (b3) and Perfect Fifth (5) intervals of each
        Minor scale. To construct the C Minor and E Minor chord you begin with
        the scale consisting of the following notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Minor Scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E Minor Scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D, E</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Extracting the three notes required from these scales means applying the
        following formula to each scale:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Minor Chord Formula: 1, b3, 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Minor Chord Formula: Root, Minor Third, Perfect Fifth</b>
      </p>

      <p>Dominant 7th Chords</p>
      <p>
        Dominant 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The
        chord is also known as the Major Minor Seventh Chord as it borrows
        intervals from both the Major scale and the Minor scale. The chord is
        formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor
        Seventh (b7). To construct the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th chord
        you begin with both scales consisting of the following notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Major Scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E Major Scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Minor Scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E Minor Scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D, E</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Extracting the four notes required from these scales means applying the
        following formula to each scale:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dominant 7th Chord Formula: 1, 3, 5, b7</b>

      <p>
        <b>

          Seventh
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th Chord consisting of
        the following notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>C Dominant 7th Chord: C, E, G, Bb</b>
