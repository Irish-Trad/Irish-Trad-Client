        than a standard mandolin (G2,D3,A3,E4). The name Octave Mandola (Europe)

        <b>String Gauge: </b>The thickness of a string. As instrument strings
        are normally sold in packs a musician will typically respond to a
        question about the string gauge they use by referring to the thinnest
        string. For example, "11's" would suggest a pack of strings with the
        thinnest string in the pack being 11.

        through hammer-ons and pull-offs on the Irish Bouzouki.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Vibrato: </b>Quick and repetitive micro-bends that create a
        fluctuating pitch. Reminiscent of a vocalist who holds a note for a long
        time.
