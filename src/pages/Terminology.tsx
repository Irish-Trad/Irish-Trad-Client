          <b>Octave Mandolin: </b>The Octave Mandolin is pitched one octave
          lower than a standard mandolin (G2,D3,A3,E4). The name Octave Mandola
          (Europe) is interchangeable with the Octave Mandolin (America). They
          are the same instrument.

          <b>String Gauge: </b>The thickness of a string. As instrument strings
          are normally sold in packs a musician will typically respond to a
          question about the string gauge they use by referring to the thinnest
          string. For example, "11's" would suggest a pack of strings with the
          thinnest string in the pack being 11.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tempo: </b>The speed at which a piece of music is played. The exact
          pace is specified by BPM.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Trill: </b>Rapid alteration between two notes. Normally achieved
          through hammer-ons and pull-offs on the Irish Bouzouki.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vibrato: </b>Quick and repetitive micro-bends that create a
          fluctuating pitch. Reminiscent of a vocalist who holds a note for a
          long time.
