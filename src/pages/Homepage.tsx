        Most people who decide to learn traditional Irish music for the first
        time do so having already played a different stringed instrument such as
        the guitar. For guitar players, the most popular method of teaching is
        through tablature because of the simplicity and ability to get a person
        playing quickly. The lessons and resources on Irish-Trad.net are
        presented in tablature (TAB) alongside traditional sheet music to
        satisfy the absolute beginner and the musically trained.
