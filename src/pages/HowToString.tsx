      <H2>Introduction:</H2>
      <Text>
        Knowing how to string your instrument is an essential skill that every
        musician needs to learn. The materials that strings are made from will
        wear down over time. Sometimes the string will unexpectedly snap during
        playing forcing you to replace it but generally musicians decide
        themselves that strings need replaced through inspection and feel.

        Beginners generally view replacing strings as a daunting task because of
        their uncertainty and fear of damaging a new instrument. Many beginners
        end up having the local music shop string the instrument for them which
        is understandable on the day the instrument is first purchased but there
        is little to no need to return to them just to have it done.
        Particularly if they charge for such a simple service.

        The following sections will cover how to string an instrument of the
        Irish Bouzouki family (CBOM - cittern, bouzouki, octave
        mandola/mandolin) and the different options available when buying
        strings such as material, gauge and different string ends.

      <H2>Stringing the instrument:</H2>
      <Text>
        When changing strings there is only one safety rule to follow:
      </Text>
      <Text>DO NOT cut the strings while they are fully tuned.</Text>
      <Text>
        Doing this would cause a very sudden change of tension on the neck of
        the instrument. It poses a slight risk of damaging the instrument itself
        but the real danger is that the string becomes an unpredictable
        high-speed metal whip. So simply never do it.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        There are arguments as to whether you should take all the strings off
        your instrument at once when replacing them or replace them only one at
        a time. The theory is that changing one string at a time minimises the
        overall difference in tension on the neck. The theory makes a little
        sense but changing one string at a time also means that you don't have
        access to the full fretboard if you want to clean it or apply some form
        of lotion. If you have the time and patience then try and change one
        string at a time but generally don't worry about it too much.

      <H2>How to:</H2>
      <Text>
        The first step is to remove the metal plate covering the tailpiece of
        your instrument. It might require a little pressure to lift off if it's
        the first time it has been moved. Figure 1 shows the removed tailpiece
        cover and the ends of each string.

        <Figcaption>Figure 1: Tailpiece cover removed</Figcaption>

      <Text>
        At the top of the instrument are tuning pegs. Turn the peg in the
        direction that causes the string to become slack. Continue unwinding
        until the string becomes loose enough that is can be removed by hand.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        With the old string removed find your new string and attach one end at
        the tailpiece. The tailpiece accepts either loop-end or ball-end strings
        depending on your instrument.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Next, bring the end of the new string past the tuning peg and then down
        through the hole. The direction is shown in Figure 2. Once the string
        has been fed through the hole bring the string clockwise, underneath and
        then over the other part of the string. Pull tight and this creates a
        tight knot. The direction to follow with the string can be seen in
        Figure 3. This method is said to improve tuning stability of the
        instrument.

        The final step is to turn the tuning peg until the string begins to
        tighten. At this point the string has now been replaced and it just
        needs to be brought to pitch. This process is repeated for every string
        and at that point you have successfully changed the strings yourself.
        The next lesson will cover how to tune the instrument to pitch.

      <H2>String types and characteristics:</H2>
      <Text>
        There are many options when it comes to choosing strings for your
        instrument. There is no definitive answer to "what strings should I
        use?" because every small change in string specification impacts the
        overall tone of your instrument and playing. As such, the "right"
        strings are simply personal preference.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This section covers the certain specifications behind strings and how
        they might impact your tone or playability. Through time and
        experimentation you will find the strings that are right for you.
      </Text>
      <H2>String Gauge:</H2>
      <Text>
        String gauge refers to the overall thickness of the string. The
        measurement is made to 1/1000 of an inch and while this number may seem
        incredibly small the fingers and ears are able to detect these changes.
        Going up in notches of 1/1000 has significant impact on the tonality and
        playability of an instrument. The general rule of thumb is that thicker
        strings provide fuller, louder and "better" sounding tones. However,
        playing melodies and pushing down on chords with an instrument using
        particularly thick strings (14/1000 or greater) can cause fatigue and
        pain in the fingers. Finding the right balance is crucial. For
        beginners, starting with a light string gauge is recommended to minimise
        pain and ease the process of building calluses.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Strings are normally sold in packets allowing you to replace all your
        strings. The string gauge for every string in the packet is based off
        the thinnest string. "11's" refer to a pack of strings with the thinnest
        string in the pack being 11. This means that the packet itself can end
        up dictating to you the string gauge of all the other strings. The
        relationship between sizes of each string also varies by brand.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        It can sometimes be important to note that instruments are set-up and
        adjusted at the factory or by a luthier to a specific set of string
        gauges. It is worth finding out this information as changing between
        different weights impacts the overall tension being placed on your
        instruments neck and in certain cases might require a new set-up so that
        instrument works efficiently.
      </Text>
      <H2>String Material:</H2>
      <Text>
        The material of each string might be the specification that provides the
        biggest significant changes in tonality. String manufacturers provide a
        variety of options such as phosphor bronze and nickel but there are some
        companies producing alloys such as 80/20 bronze and others experimenting
        with technology to coat strings in attempts to slow down the corrosion
        process and ageing of strings.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        A very general rule of thumb as to the tonality each material provides
        would be as follows:
      </Text>
      <UL>
        <LI>Phosphor Bronze - bright sparkling tone</LI>
        <LI>80/20 Bronze - bright, crisp, yet bass-heavy tone</LI>
        <LI>Nickel - more mellow tone</LI>
      </UL>
      <Text>
        As with every string specification this is another personal preference
        that based on the sheer number of variations available might take years
        of experimenting to decide on a favourite.
      </Text>
      <H2>String Types:</H2>
      <Text>
        Another specification with a significant impact on the tone of an
        instrument is the option between stringing in your instrument in an
        octave or unison/double strung manner.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        A set of strings that are unison strung means that you receive 4 pairs
        of the same gauge strings. For example, an Irish Bouzouki with a set of
        unison strung 11's tuned to standard pitch will be:
      </Text>
      <UL>
        <LI>E String - .011" (x2)</LI>
        <LI>A String - .016" (x2)</LI>
        <LI>D String - .028" (x2)</LI>
        <LI>G String - .040" (x2)</LI>
      </UL>
      <Text>
        A set of strings that are octave strung means that the two lowest
        pitched (thickest) strings are paired with a thinner string to create a
        unique chorusing tonality from the instrument. For example, an Irish
        Bouzouki with a set of octave strung 11's tuned to standard pitch will
        be:
      </Text>
      <UL>
        <LI>E String - .011" (x2)</LI>
        <LI>A String - .016" (x2)</LI>
        <LI>D String - .013" (octave)</LI>
        <LI>D String - .028"</LI>
        <LI>G String - .018" (octave)</LI>
        <LI>G String - .040"</LI>
      </UL>
      <Text>
        Important to note is that if an instrument comes from the factory or
        luthier with octave strings already on then switching to unison strings
        at a later date may require the instrument to be set-up professionally
        as the nut at the top of the instrument may not have been recessed to
        fit the thicker strings.
      </Text>
      <H2>String Ends:</H2>
      <Text>
        The specific end used on a string is likely to have little to zero
        impact on tonality of your instrument but is vital to know to ensure
        that the strings work at all with your tailpiece. Strings come with
        either a loop-end, ball-end and sometimes a dual (ball/loop combo).
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The type of end you require depends on the tailpiece of the instrument.
        Luckily, it is easy to distinguish. If you look at the tailpiece and
        there are little tags sticking up then the instrument accepts loop-end
        strings. This is the case for the instrument shown in Figure 1 above.
        The loop itself latches onto the little tags. Otherwise, if the tags are
        shaped more like a little enclosure with a small gap in the middle then
        this is for ball-end strings.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The dual ball/loop-end combos that are sometimes available provide peace
        of mind when it comes to deciding. However, they can sometimes cost
        extra and considering how easy it is to determine which kind you need
        you may as well get the correct end outright.
